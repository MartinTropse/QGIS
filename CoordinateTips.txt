QGIS does projection on the fly. To change these settings go to "options" and then "CRS". 
Set "CRS for Layers" to "Use Project CRS" and "CRS for Projects" to "Use CRS from first layer added".

If you then add a SWEREF99 background map and then add the WGS84 layer, it will automatically be projected to the right location. 
The CRS will however remain WGS84, and changing the CRS within QGIS will cause the points to change location. 

Therefor you need to export the layer and then set the prefered CRS after QGIS have correclty projected the data "on the fly"
